    "# BADS Exercise 8 on ensemble learning\n",
    "This exercise revisits some of the concepts covered in [Tutorial 8 on ensemble learning](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/bads/blob/master/tutorials/8_nb_ensemble_learning.ipynb). We will take a close look at bagging and analyze its impact on the predictive accuracy, and implement one of the boosting algorithms, Adaboost.\n",

    "## Loading the data \n",
    "Fo this tutorial, we will use HMEQ credit risk data available at [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/bads/blob/master/data/hmeq_prepared.csv). By now, you have imported different data sets multiple times in previous tutorials, but this step is always necessary when working with data. Your preliminary task is to load the HMEQ data set into a `pandas DataFrame`."
